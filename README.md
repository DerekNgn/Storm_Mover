# Storm_Mover
## Nothing can stop us from moving!

COMP4555 - final assignment

The game was written using pygame.
The game consists of 3 files: 
game.py - game setup and events handling 
sprites.py - all game objects and their properties
settings.py - constant values storage for easier game difficulty modifications

Game's main idea is simple:
◦ Collect as many packages as possible while trying to avoid getting hit by hail

Future plans:
◦ Improve sprites by adding animations
◦ Add many more types of challenges
◦ Implement story mode or global leaderboard
